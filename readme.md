### LLMs / Reinforcement Learning
- **[Heuristics Considered Harmful: RL With Random Rewards Should Not Make LLMs Reason](https://fuchsia-arch-d8e.notion.site/Heuristics-Considered-Harmful-RL-With-Random-Rewards-Should-Not-Make-LLMs-Reason-21ba29497c4180ca86ffce303f01923d)** - A blog post investigating claims that Reinforcement Learning (RL) with random rewards can enable reasoning in LLMs. The authors find that this behavior is dependent on specific heuristics in the RL algorithm, not an emergent property. `Blog`

### Legal Tech / NLP
- **[Open-Sourced Dataset of 99% of US Caselaw](https://huggingface.co/datasets/common-pile/caselaw_access_project)** - A large dataset containing 99% of US caselaw has been open-sourced on Hugging Face. This resource allows developers to build legal tech applications without paying high premiums for the data. `Dataset`

### Geospatial Data / Data Science
- **[Talk: The Difficulty of Geo-referencing Events Correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsNwvqnyQBU)** - A video of a talk discussing the challenges of accurately geo-referencing events and the potential pitfalls of regressions based on unverified GIS strategies. `Video`

### Statistics
- **[Blog: Survey Statistics with Longitudinal/Panel Data](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/07/15/survey-statistics-longitudinal-panel-data/)** - A blog post discussing statistical methods and considerations for working with longitudinal or panel survey data. `Blog`

### Bayesian Statistics
- **[Blog: Readings and a New Book on Bayesian Meta-Analysis](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/07/15/a-bunch-of-readings-and-a-new-book-on-bayesian-meta-analysis/)** - A collection of readings and an announcement for a new book focusing on Bayesian meta-analysis techniques. `Blog`

### ML Research / Metascience
- **[Blog: The Metascience of Pull Requests](https://www.argmin.net/p/metascience-of-pull-requests)** - A blog post proposing an alternative to checklists and statistical mandates in machine learning research, suggesting a workflow based on pull requests to improve rigor and collaboration. `Blog`
