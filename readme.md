* Datasets
    - **[Caselaw Access Project](https://huggingface.co/datasets/common-pile/caselaw_access_project)** - An open-source dataset containing 99% of US caselaw, available on Hugging Face. It provides a free alternative to premium legal tech data, enabling developers to build applications on top of it. `Dataset`

* LLMs
