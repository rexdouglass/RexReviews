* ### LLMs / Reinforcement Learning
    * **Heuristics Considered Harmful: RL With Random Rewards Should Not Make LLMs Reason (Blog)**
        > A blog post investigating claims that Reinforcement Learning (RL) with random rewards can enable reasoning in LLMs. The authors find that this behavior is dependent on specific heuristics in the RL algorithm, not an emergent property.
